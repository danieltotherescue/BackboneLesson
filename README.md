# BackboneLesson

Hi All!

##Task:
Backbone groups needs to create a client-side only single page application (no server-side) that has a form for collecting data into a list of rows and columns. The user should be able to sort the collection by clicking on the column headers. You do not need to persist data.

###Visual Aids

gifs,
diagrams,
other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible

(but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).

####Similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.

######Differences:
Backbone has a collections component, and collections are a group of models. Behind the scenes, collections are really just JavaScript arrays. There's also the Backbone events component. This component allows us to bind custom JavaScript events to our code.

Now Backbone sync is the last component. It's mostly used to help Backbone communicate with server side technologies like databases. We won't be needing this today because we are only building a client-side app. 



Any code files that are needed should be included in this repo. This includes things like Gemfile or package.json!
